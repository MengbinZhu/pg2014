Python for Geosciences 2014


Description:
------------

This course provides an introduction to data analysis and graphical representation of oceanographic data 
using the Python programming language. Topics include how to read and write data using standard 
formats; modern programming techniques including object oriented programming, version control 
systems, and the model-view-controller paradigm; plotting geophysical data using various projections, 
best practices in plotting, and interactive plotting.

Learning outcomes: 
------------------

Students will compile and run parallel codes for use on distributed memory supercomuters, use batch 
scheduling of computer programs, and identify and fix problems in standard supercomputer management 
software. Students will create programs that use multiple processors using the Message Passing 
Interface. Students will analyze large data sets. Students will collaborate on a class project using 
standard tools such as Version Control Systems for maintaining collaborative software projects. Students 
will create scripts in the Python programming language to solve research problems.

Course Outline: 
---------------

#####Week 1-2: Core language

Overview of the standard python programming language, standard data containers (lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc), 
importing packages, for/while loops, and functions. 

#####Week 3-4: Numerical python 

Using numpy and scipy, vector operations, and best practices for large numerical datasets.

#####Week 5: Basic plotting in python

Overview of the matplotlib plotting package.

#####Week 6-7: Plotting on the earth

The Basemap package, the proj3 library, and other geospatial applications.

#####Week 8: NetCDF

Reading and writing NetCDF files locally and over the internet.

#####Week 9-10: Object Oriented programming and data structures

Object oriented programing (OOP) techniques, and good programming practices. OOP as a surrogate for data structures.

#####Week 11: Wrapping FORTRAN code

Wrapping FORTRAN code using f2py, and other numerical performance code techniques.

#####Week 12: Creating and distributing large projects

How to create and distrubute a large python package using standard techniques, like distutils and github.

#####Week 13-14: Group project presentations.


##Get a scientific python distribution (roughly in order of awesomeness):

- Anaconda python:
        https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/
- Enthought Python Distribution/Canopy:
        https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/
- Pythonxy:
        https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/
- And myriad other linux distributions through package managersâ€¦
